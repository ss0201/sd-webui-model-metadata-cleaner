# SD WebUI Model Metadata Cleaner

An extension for the Stable Diffusion WebUI to clean up unused metadata files.
It removes metadata files in the checkpoint/lora/embeddings/hypernetworks directory that have no matching model file (a model file with the same name as the metadata file).
This tool is experimental, so use it with caution.
